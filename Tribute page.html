                    About the Legend

                <p>&#187 Avul pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul kalam was born on 15 october 1931, to ta tamil muslim family in
                    the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the
                    state of
                    Tamil nadu.</p>
                <p>&#187 He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
                    Research
                    and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                    involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came
                    to be
                    known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile
                    and launch vehicle technology.</P>
                <p>&#187 He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                    nuclear
                    tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.Kalam was elected as the
                    11th
                    president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                    Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                    President".</p>
                <p>&#187 From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as
                    principal
                    scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent
                    role
                    in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established
                    Kalam as
                    a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998
                    Kalam
                    put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for
                    transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for,
                    among
                    other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for
                    economic
                    growth, and widening access to health care and education.</p>
                <p>&#187 In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing
                    President
                    Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he
                    was
                    Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian
                    National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as
                    India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his
                    term
                    in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.</p>
                <p>&#187 Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to
                    transform
                    India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015,
                    he
                    collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was
                    pronounced
                    dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings
                    of
                    Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards were two of the country’s highest honours, the Padma
                    Vibhushan
                    (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997).</p>
